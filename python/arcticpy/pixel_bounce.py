class PixelBounce:

    """
    In flat fields acquired during ground testing of Euclid CCDs, the serial
    overscan shows spurious features that may be a combination of CTI and pixel
    bounce. In particular, the spurious signal dies away over several pixels but
    is not monotonic. An increase between pixels 2 and 3 of the overscan region
    cannot be due to CTI.

    To model pixel bounce, we regard the reference voltage as receiving an
    impulse when the signal voltage changes suddenly, then returning to ground
    as a heavily damped harmonic oscillator. Correlated double sampling then
    produces a spurious, oscillating bias offset in the first few pixels after
    the change in signal.

    Parameters of a damped harmonic oscillator are
    * the natural frequency and damping - both of which presumably depend on
      capacitance between the sampling phase and ground.
    * an initial amplitude and velocity of oscillation - which could depend on
      the coupling between the signal and reference voltage, and the clocking time,
      during which the spurious bias might start to oscillate unnoticed.


    Parameters
    ----------
    kA : float
        Initial condition of reference volatage in the pixel after a change in
        signal voltage.
    kv : float
        Initial condition of rate of change of reference volatage in the pixel
        after a change in signal voltage.
    gamma : float
        Damping coefficicent of oscillations in the reference voltage, expressed
        as a ~half life in units of the time between clocks.
    omega : float
        Frequency of oscillations in the reference voltage, in units (per pixel)
        i.e. freq in Hz * clock speed.

        Applies pixel bounce to an image and returns the bias.

        The bias array is what is subtracted from the image to add pixel bounce. This function is separate from
        `add_pixel_bounce` to allow the bias to be calculated multiple times (e.g. for different pixel bounce
        classes) and then all added to the same image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image : [[float]]
            The input array of pixel values, assumed to be in units of electrons.

            The first dimension is the "row" (y) index, the second is the "column"
            (x) index. Pixel bounce is only ever added in the x direction (ie during
            serial readout for images oriented as usual in ArCTIc).

        parallel_window_start/stop : int
            First and last row of pixels (in the y direction) to process, for speed.
            Default is to process the entire image.

        serial_window_start/stop : int
            First and last column of pixels (in the x direction) to process, for speed.
            Default is to process the entire image.

        Returns
        -------
        bias : [[float]]
